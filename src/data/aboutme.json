I'm interested mostly in how things around me are created first, then trying to replicate it. And if I find something interesting, I'll invest all of my time and effort on it and enjoy the process!"

        "description": "Back in secondary school we were taught QBasic and a year after that we started VB6. Those were fun days when I realized I have a lot of interest in programming and creating things, whether through code or not. Creation has always been my hobby! In high school, we were being taught C++ which I already knew and managed to succeed greatly in that year with. Those years in school were the ones I tried to pick up different languages either by finding them interesting or being forced to use them in order to create certain things. Languages like Pawn, Lua, C, C++ HTML&CSS, PHP, and C# were those I kept messing with and created small things for myself."
