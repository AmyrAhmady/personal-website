        "description": "Back in secondary school we were taught QBasic and a year after that we start VB6, those were fun days which I realized I have a lot of interests in programming and creating things, whether through code or not, creation has always been my hobby! Then after that, in high school, we were being taught C++ which I already knew and managed to succeed greatly in that year with. Those years in school were the ones I tried to pick up different languages either by finding them interesting or being forced to use them in order to create certain things, languages like Pawn, Lua, C, C++ HTML&CSS, PHP, and C# were those I kept messing with and created small things for myself."
