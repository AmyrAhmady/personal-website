    "description": "I have a deep passion for creating—whether it’s editing a photo, producing a video, or building a fun, quirky app. I'm fascinated by how things work, often reverse-engineering them just to learn and recreate them myself. When something grabs my interest, I go all in—pouring my time, energy, and creativity into it. I don’t just build things—I enjoy the entire journey of discovery and creation."

    "title": "Early Start in Programming and a Lifelong Love for Building",
    "description": "My programming journey began in secondary school with QBasic, followed by Visual Basic 6 the next year—those early experiences sparked a lasting passion for building things. In high school, I already had a strong foundation in C++ before it was formally introduced in class, which allowed me to excel. Over the years, I experimented with many languages, both out of curiosity and necessity—languages like Pawn, Lua, C, C++, HTML & CSS, PHP, and C#. Whether I was coding out of interest or to solve a challenge, I constantly found joy in creating, exploring, and learning."
